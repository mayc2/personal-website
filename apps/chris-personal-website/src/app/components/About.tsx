            I grew up in a small town outside of Annapolis, MD. I moved to
            upstate New York for college and now reside in the San Francisco Bay
            Area.

            I enjoy all things active! You will catch me playing sports year
            round, hiking during the summer and ski/snowboarding in the winter.
