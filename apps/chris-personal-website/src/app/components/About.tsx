          <br />
          My most recent work experience has been developing the front-end
          codelines and build systems of Workdayâ€™s analytics platform.
          <br />I have experience building enterprise level web applications
          that serve a broad range of Fortune 500 companies. I take pride in my
          contributions towards multiple product and platform go-lives. Thanks
          for your time!
